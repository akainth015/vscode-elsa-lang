# Elsa

Syntax highlighting and auto complete for UCSD's Elsa programming language.

When autocompleting an alias, the "(expand)" version may be selected to replace
it with what it aliases. This is particularly useful while performing definition 
expansions.

## Release Notes

- v1.0.2: Document the extension more extensively
- v1.0.1: Support autocompletion of aliases
- v0.0.1: Initial version released. It may doesn't work well due to my inexperience on syntax stuffs.
